hammerspoon lua scirpt for emulation of shiftIt

I love ShiftIt on macOS until Mojave.
But on the Catalina, ShiftIt does not work and seems to stop further support.

Alternative software, Hammerspoon needs lua scirpt for config.

This is an example of my personal setting.

[Option]+[Command] + [Up] => Height Half Window on Top
[Option]+[Command] + [Down] => Height Half Window on Bottom

[CTRL]+[Option]+[Command] + [Right] => move Quarter Window to Right
[CTRL]+[Option]+[Command] + [Left] => move Quarter Window to Right
[CTRL]+[Option]+[Command] + [Up] => move Quarter Window to Top
[CTRL]+[Option]+[Command] + [Down] => move Quarter Window to Bottom
